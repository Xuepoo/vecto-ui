Add touch / pointer-drag support.

- `core`: `Scene` calls `setPointerCapture` on `pointerdown` and releases it on `pointerup`, so a drag keeps receiving `pointermove`/`pointerup` after the pointer leaves the node's box; interactive shadow nodes get `touch-action: none` so the browser doesn't claim touch drags (the canvas owns its gestures).
- `ui`: `ScrollView` now scrolls by pointer-drag (touch & mouse), not just the wheel — content follows the finger 1:1 and clamps to the content bounds. The wheel/drag clamping is shared in one helper.
